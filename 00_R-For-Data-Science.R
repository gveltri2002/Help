#### Data Visualization ####

library(palmerpenguins)  #contains a dataset
library(ggthemes)  #colorblind friendly palette

# === === === === === ===
## First Steps ##
# Do penguins with longer flippers weigh more or less than penguins with shorter flippers? What does the relationship between flipper length and body mass look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear? Does the relationship vary by the species of the penguin? How about by the island where the penguin lives? 

# Letâ€™s create visualizations that we can use to answer these questions.

glimpse(penguins)

  data = penguins, 
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +

# Categorical Variables
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar()

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_infreq(species))) +  # reorders the bars!
  geom_bar()



# Numerical Variables
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + # histograms
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + # density plots => smoothed histograms

# === === === === === ===

## Visualizing Relationships => mapping 2 variables

# Numerical + Categorical => boxplots and density plots
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Two Categorical => stacked bar chart and relative frequency plots
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) + # stacked bat chart
  geom_bar()

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) + # relative frq plot
  geom_bar(position = "fill") # NOTE THE CHANGE



# Two Numerical => scatter plots/smooth curves
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()



# 3 or More => mapping additional aesthetics/facets
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = island))

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +

## Saving Your Plots ##

# Use ggsave() to save plots
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "penguin-plot.png")



# Exercises
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")

?ggsave
ggsave("mpg-plot.pdf")

## Common Problems ##

# - Check syntax: match parenthesis and ", 
# - Make sure + is at the end of the line for ggplot
# - use ? if you get stuck

## Dplyr Basics ##
# 1. The first argument is always a data frame.
# 2. The subsequent arguments typically describe which columns to operate on using the variable names (without quotes).
# 3. The output is always a new data frame.

flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "IAH") %>%  
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarize(
    arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# === === === === === ===

## Rows ##

# filter() = changes which ROWS are present without changing the order
flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 120)

#Flights that departed on January 1
flights %>% 
  filter(month == 1 & day == 1)

#Flights that departed in January OR February
flights %>% 
  filter(month == 1 | month == 2)

flights %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 2))



# arrange() = changes the order of ROWS based on which columns are present, doesn't filter data
flights %>% 
  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) #filters by earliest year, then month, then dep_time

flights %>% 
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) #desc() = orders big to small (descending)



# distinct() = finds unique rows in a dataset
# Remove duplicate rows, if any
flights %>% 
  distinct()

# Find all unique origin and destination pairs
flights %>% 
  distinct(origin, dest)

flights %>% 
  distinct(origin, dest, .keep_all = TRUE) # .keep_all = keeps all other columns



# count() = counts the number of rows that meet unique criteria
flights %>% 
  count(origin, dest, sort = TRUE)



# Exercises
names(flights)
flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay >= 120)

flights %>%
  filter(dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")

flights %>%
  filter(month %in% c(7, 8, 9))

flights %>%
  filter(arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)

flights %>%
  filter(dep_delay >= 60 & arr_delay < 30)


flights %>% 
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))

flights %>% 
  arrange(sched_dep_time)

flights %>%
  arrange(air_time) %>%

flights %>%

flights %>%
  distinct(flight, distance) %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance))
  
flights %>%
  distinct(flight, distance) %>% 
  arrange(distance)

# === === === === === ===

## Columns ##

# mutate() = make news columns from old
flights %>% 
  mutate(
    gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
    speed = distance / air_time * 60,
    .after = day # adds new columns after day instead of left side
  )

flights %>% 
  mutate(
    gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
    hours = air_time / 60,
    gain_per_hour = gain / hours,
    .keep = "used"
  )

# select() = choses which columns to display
#Select columns by name:
flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day)

#Select all columns between year and day (inclusive):
flights %>% 
  select(year:day)

#Select all columns except those from year to day (inclusive):
flights %>% 
  select(!year:day)



# Exercises
flights %>% 
  select(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay)

flights %>% 
  select(day, year, day, day)

variables <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")

flights %>% 
  select(any_of(variables))

flights %>% 
  select(contains("time", ignore.case = FALSE))
?contains

## The Pipe ##
# Allows you to combine multiple commands together => ex find the fastest flights to IAH
flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "IAH") %>% 
  mutate(speed = distance / air_time * 60) %>% 
  select(year:day, dep_time, carrier, flight, speed) %>% 
  arrange(desc(speed))

## Groups

# group_by() = divide data set into groups meaningful for analysis, subsequent outputs work in the group
flights %>%
  group_by(month)



# summarize() = presents summary stats, if used with group does one per group
flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )



# slice_ = allows you to extract specific rows from groups
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  slice_max(arr_delay, n = 1) %>% # n = # can be replaced with p = # to give a proportion of the data set
  relocate(dest)



# You can group my multiple variables
daily <- flights %>%  
  group_by(year, month, day)



# ungroup() = ungroups the data
daily %>% 
  ungroup()

# .by = can be used to group within a single operation
flights %>% 
  summarize(
    delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 
    n = n(),
    .by = month
  )

flights %>% 
  summarize(
    delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 
    n = n(),
    .by = c(origin, dest)
  )
